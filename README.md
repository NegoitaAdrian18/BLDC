In progress ...


The aim of the project is to create an application for designing of Brashless DC  Motors.
Based on the user input, will be created the geomtrical parts of the electrical motor. Then will be analyzed the electrical parts, such as resistance of the winding, 
inductance of the winding and so on. 
Will be also analyzed from electromagnetic point of view and the losses that may occur as well.
